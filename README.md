# Google-Interview-Preparation
Interview preparation for my interview in March of 2016.

The questions were taken from https://www.careercup.com/page?pid=google-interview-questions&amp;n=1

The py files are named in the order of my progress, the py files themselves have the problems at the top lines in docstring format as well as a url to the problem on the website.

## Phone technical screenv was March 17th, got affirmation I passed March 18th.

I currently have asked for ~2 weeks extra prep for the onsite interview. Will post the results here.
